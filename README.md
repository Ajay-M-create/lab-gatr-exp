**Key Directories and Files:**

- `data/`: Contains raw and processed datasets.
- `models/`: Holds the implementation of machine learning models.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and analysis.
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for data preprocessing and other tasks.
- `environment_anatomygen_gatr.yml`: Conda environment configuration file.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Installation

To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash:lab-gatr-exp/README.md
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/lab-gatr-exp.git
   cd lab-gatr-exp
   ```

2. **Install Conda**

   Ensure you have [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed. If not, download and install it from the official website.

3. **Create the Conda Environment**

   Use the provided `environment_anatomygen_gatr.yml` file to create the environment.

   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment_anatomygen_gatr.yml
   ```

4. **Activate the Environment**

   ```bash
   conda activate anatomygen_gatr
   ```

## Usage

After setting up the environment, you can run the implemented models as follows:

### Running Transformer Implemented Model

To execute the transformer-based model:

```bash:lab-gatr-exp/README.md
python models/transformer_implemented.py
```

**Description:**

The `transformer_implemented.py` script initializes and trains a transformer model on the provided dataset. Ensure that your data is correctly placed in the `data/processed/` directory before running the script.

### Running GATr Implemented Model

To execute the Graph Attention Network (GAT) model:

```bash
python models/GATr_implemented.py
```

**Description:**

The `GATr_implemented.py` script sets up and trains a GAT model. Similar to the transformer script, verify that the necessary data is available in the `data/processed/` directory.
